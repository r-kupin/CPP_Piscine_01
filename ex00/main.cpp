		Google C++ Style Guide

 		REFERENCES VS POINTERS
	- Use references when you can, and pointers when you have to.
	- References are usually preferred over pointers whenever you don't need
		"reseating". This usually means that references are most useful in a
		class's public interface. References typically appear on the skin of an
		object, and pointers on the inside.
	- The exception to the above is where a function's parameter or return
		value needs a "sentinel" reference â€” a reference that does not refer to
		an object. This is usually best done by returning/taking a pointer, and
		giving the NULL pointer this special significance (references must
		always alias objects, not a dereferenced NULL pointer).

		Description

	1.  std::move
 			constexpr std::remove_reference_t<T>&& move( T&& t ) noexcept;
 		Is used to indicate that an object t may be "moved from", i.e. allowing
 		the efficient transfer of resources from t to another object. It is
 		widely used to initialize non-primitive value from an existing rvalue,
 		similar to creating an object with move-constructor
 			Use:
				Zombie zombie("Andy");
 			Implementation examples:
 				Zombie::Zombie(std::string name): name_(name){};
 					*BAD* - the "name" is allocated, then name's content
					is copied to it, then "Andy" rvalue gets destroyed.
				Zombie::Zombie(std::string name): name(std::move(name)) {};
					*GOOD* - std::move() doesn't actually move anything.
					It changes an expression from being an lvalue (such as a
					named variable) to being an xvalue. An xvalue tells the
					compiler: You can plunder me, move anything I'm holding and
					use it elsewhere (since I'm going to be destroyed soon
					anyway)". in other words, when you use std::move(x), you're
					allowing the compiler to cannibalize x. Thus if x has, say,
					its own buffer in memory - after std::move()ing the compiler
					can reassign it to specified object.
